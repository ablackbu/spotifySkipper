# spotifySkipper


These python scripts are designed to allow a user to run in conjunction with a desktop Spotify client. The idea behind this is simple. Spotify makes curated playlists which auto update that may contain tracks you do not want to listen to. They do not provide away to blacklist these tracks and since the playlist is  auto updating and out of your control you can't simply remove it. Even if you could that would be cumbersome. 

Ideally this would work on ALL platforms mobile included. Currently I am just targeting Linux, MacOS, and Windows. 

I need to add some daemon support across all platforms so it is just a double click or something you can startup automatically.
